            <h3>Learning Web Development</h3>
            <p>First I learn HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, which is the foundation of all websites. Itâ€™s the main file type that is loaded in my browser when I look at my website. The HTML file contains all the content on the page, and it uses tags to denote different types of content.</p>
            <p>Second I learn CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, lets me style that HTML content so it looks nice and fancy. I can add colors, custom fonts, and layout the elements of my website however I want them to look. I can even create animations and shapes with CSS!</p>
            <p>Third I learn JavaScript, which is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser. Using JavaScript, I can make my website dynamic, meaning it will respond to different inputs from the user, or other sources.</p>
